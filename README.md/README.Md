AI & the Evolution of Student Learning â€” A Research Deep Dive
Project Summary
This project is an evidence-based research deep dive into the impact of generative AI on student learning and academic integrity. By synthesizing both quantitative and qualitative data, this analysis moves beyond alarmist headlines to provide a nuanced, actionable understanding of how students, educators, and institutions are navigating the new landscape of AI-supported education.

Methodology
The analysis leverages a multi-pronged approach to gather insights from various sources:

API Scraping: A Python script was used to scrape public posts and sentiment data from Reddit on subreddits related to education, technology, and AI ethics.

Standardized Test Data: Historical data from national standardized tests (ACT and SAT) was analyzed to challenge the narrative that AI use is directly correlated with a decline in critical thinking skills.

Qualitative & Policy Review: A synthesis of recent academic papers, research reports, and official guidance from leading educational bodies (e.g., UNESCO, U.S. Department of Education) was conducted to build a comprehensive picture of usage, outcomes, and policy trends.

Key Findings
Usage is Widespread: The majority of students are actively using AI tools for tasks like brainstorming, outlining, and code scaffolding.

Learning Effects are Nuanced: Evidence suggests that AI's impact on learning is mixed but can be positive when used in targeted, scaffolded ways.

"Cheating Crisis" Narrative is Overstated: The data suggests a shift in the methods of academic dishonesty, rather than an explosion in overall cheating rates. Detection tools are unreliable and carry significant bias risks.

Policy is Evolving: Institutions are moving away from outright bans toward policies that promote responsible use, human oversight, and AI literacy.

Project Structure
The repository is organized to reflect a professional data science workflow, with distinct folders for each stage of the project:

data/: Contains all raw data collected from scraping and external sources.

docs/: Houses the original research framework and journal.

reports/: Stores final outputs, including charts, graphs, and summary images.

src/: Intended for all Python code and scripts.

README.md: Provides a high-level overview of the project.

Current Status
The project's research, data collection, and analysis are complete. All results are present in the data/ and reports/ folders. The code to reproduce these results is in a "work-in-progress" state due to a technical issue with the API authentication. The goal is to resolve this to provide a fully reproducible project in the near future.
